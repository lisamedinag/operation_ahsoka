            <p>The bounty hunter Din Djarin, known as "the Mandalorian" or "mando", is in charge of Grogu as he travels
                the galaxy performing all kinds of assignments. This time, he's faced with a specially hard mission in
                which he'll need a hand... yours!</p>
            <p>Mando needs to make a delivery to a contact in the planet Nevada. If he succeeds the contact will give him
            information on Ahsoka's whereabouts, and he can have her master Grogu as a Jedi. </p>
            <p>Your mission is to keep Grogu from eating the delivery, which consists in 3 blue-cookie boxes, 3 unfertilized
                frog eggs and 3 frogs. </p>
